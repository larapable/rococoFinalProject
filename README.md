# Bus Seat Reservation System

## Overview
The **Bus Seat Reservation System** is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of reserving bus seats online. Built within the ServiceNow platform, this application provides an accessible, user-friendly interface for the public to check bus availability, make seat reservations, and manage bookings. The system includes dedicated access controls for three types of users: general users, operators, and administrators, each with different permissions and levels of functionality. 

## Key Features
- **User Roles**: 
  - **Users** (registered and guests): Can reserve seats, view availability, confirm reservations, and cancel bookings through the Service Portal.
  - **Operators**: Manage reservations, view schedules, and receive notifications for new or updated bookings.
  - **Administrators**: Configure system settings, manage bus stop and bus unit availability, and access data analytics on reservation trends.
  
- **Reservation Management**: Users can select buses, choose seat numbers, and view trip details, including departure times and estimated costs. Users are notified if their chosen origin stop is not a terminal, with an estimated arrival time displayed.

- **Bus and Seat Availability**: Real-time seat and bus availability information is shown to users, with options to update or cancel reservations before a specified time frame.

- **Automated Notifications**: Email notifications are sent to operators upon new or updated reservations and to users in cases where bus details change.
